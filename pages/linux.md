## What do the numbers in a manual page mean. For example, when I type `man ls` I see `LS(1)`
### The number corresponds to what section of the manual that page is from. The man page for man itself (`man man`) explains it and lists the standard ones: ```MANUAL SECTIONS
       The standard sections of the manual include:

       1      User Commands

       2      System Calls

       3      C Library Functions

       4      Devices and Special Files

       5      File Formats and Conventions

       6      Games et. Al.

       7      Miscellanea

       8      System Administration tools and Deamons
